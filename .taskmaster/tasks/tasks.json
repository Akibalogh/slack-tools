        "description": "Update the ETL system's Telegram parsing logic to properly detect and process all available chat directories instead of only finding 1 out of 3,958 directories.",
        "details": "The current implementation has a critical flaw in how it traverses and processes Telegram chat exports. The issue is that the parser is not correctly identifying chat directories because it's looking for HTML files in subdirectories, while the actual structure has a single messages.html file in each chat directory.\n\nImplementation steps:\n1. Review the current parsing logic to understand the exact failure point\n2. Modify the directory traversal algorithm to:\n   - Correctly identify chat directories by looking for the presence of a \"messages.html\" file\n   - Implement proper recursion or iteration through all directories in the export\n   - Add logging to track the number of directories processed\n3. Update the extraction logic to:\n   - Parse each messages.html file to extract chat metadata (participants, dates, etc.)\n   - Filter for company-specific chats based on established criteria\n   - Normalize the extracted data for downstream processing\n4. Implement error handling for malformed HTML files or unexpected directory structures\n5. Add performance optimizations to handle the large volume (3,958 directories)\n   - Consider parallel processing if appropriate\n   - Implement batching if memory constraints are an issue\n6. Update documentation to reflect the new parsing approach\n\nThe code will likely need to modify functions related to file system traversal and HTML parsing. Pay special attention to character encoding when reading HTML files to ensure proper text extraction.",

Create a test dataset with a sample of the Telegram export structure:\n   - Include multiple chat directories with messages.html files\n   - Include some directories that should be filtered out\n   - Include edge cases like empty directories or malformed HTML\n\n2. Unit tests:\n   - Test the directory traversal function to verify it finds all chat directories\n   - Test the HTML parsing function with various message formats\n   - Test the company-specific filtering logic\n\n3. Integration tests:\n   - Run the updated ETL process on the test dataset\n   - Verify the correct number of chats are detected (should be close to 3,958 in production)\n   - Verify the extracted data matches expected format\n\n4. Performance testing:\n   - Measure processing time for various dataset sizes\n   - Verify memory usage remains within acceptable limits\n\n5. Production validation:\n   - Run the updated parser on a subset of production data\n   - Compare results with manual verification of several randomly selected chats\n   - Monitor logs for any errors or warnings during processing\n   - Verify the full count of detected chats matches the expected 3,958 directories",

When processing 3,958 directories, they all get stored under the same key \"Exported Data\" and overwrite each other, resulting in only 1 chat being detected.\n\n**Current Logic Flaw:**\n```python\ntitle = soup.find('title')\nchat_name = title.text.strip() if title else html_file.replace('.html', '')\n```\n\n**Directory Structure Confirmed:**\n- 3,958 chat directories (chat_0001, chat_0002, etc.)\n- Each contains 1+ HTML files (messages.html, messages2.html, etc.)\n- All HTML files have identical title: \"Exported Data\"\n\n**Solution Needed:** Use the directory name (chat_0001, chat_0002, etc.) or extract actual chat name from message content instead of relying on the HTML title tag.\n\n**Next Steps:** Update parsing logic to use directory names as unique identifiers and extract actual chat names from message content or participant lists.\n</info added on 2025-09-13T17:23:25.079Z>",

The issue was that the ETL script was running from the wrong directory (src/etl/) instead of the project root. After correcting this, the script now properly processes all 3,958 chat directories, each containing a messages.html file. The implementation successfully identifies chat directories following the pattern \"chat_XXXX\" where XXXX is a 4-digit number. The fix resulted in finding 45 companies with Telegram data (up from just 1 previously), with a total processing time of approximately 4 minutes for all directories. The traversal algorithm now correctly handles the directory structure, with no errors reported during traversal.

        "testStrategy": "1. **Pre-Execution Testing**:\n   - Verified script functionality in a test environment\n   - Tested with a small subset of channels before full execution\n   - Confirmed proper error handling by monitoring responses\n   - Verified logging functionality captured all required information\n\n2. **Execution Verification**:\n   - Used script output to verify Dave's membership in all channels\n   - Compared the list of channels where Dave should be added against actual membership\n   - Verified Slack API responses for each addition attempt\n   - Confirmed rate limiting handling during bulk operations\n\n3. **Post-Implementation Verification**:\n   - Verified Dave's access in all 116 active channels\n   - Confirmed Dave can view channel history and post messages\n   - Verified Dave appears in the member list for each active channel\n   - Confirmed expected behavior for archived channels (cannot add members)\n\n4. **Documentation Review**:\n   - Reviewed error logs for completeness and clarity\n   - Verified the summary report accurately reflects the actual state\n   - Ensured all exceptions are properly documented with reasons\n   - Confirmed 100% success rate for all active channels",
