Naming Convention Mismatches:\n   - Slack: company-bitsafe (e.g., allnodes-bitsafe)\n   - Telegram: company names (e.g., Allnodes <> BitSafe)\n   - Need to normalize names for comparison\n\n2. Data Source Processing:\n   - Slack data from unified_commission_analysis.py\n   - Telegram data from company_mapping_table.py\n   - Different processing pipelines may cause mismatches\n\n3. Customer List Differences:\n   - Slack: Focused on BitSafe channels\n   - Telegram: Broader customer base\n   - Some companies may be in both but named differently\n\nINVESTIGATION STEPS:\n1. Compare customer lists between platforms\n2. Normalize company names (remove suffixes, standardize format)\n3. Check for naming variations (e.g., \"Allnodes\" vs \"allnodes\")\n4. Verify data processing pipelines\n5. Identify expected overlaps based on business logic\n\nEXPECTED OVERLAPS:\n- Companies like Allnodes, Republic, Round13 should appear in both\n- BitSafe customers should have both Slack and Telegram presence\n- High-value customers typically use multiple communication channels\n\nOUTPUT:\n- List of potential overlaps\n- Naming normalization recommendations\n- Data processing pipeline fixes\n- Updated customer mapping strategy\n\nINVESTIGATION COMPLETED - KEY FINDINGS:\n✅ FOUND 49 ACTUAL OVERLAPS! The issue was naming convention mismatches.\n\nOVERLAPS IDENTIFIED:\n- MPCH: Slack \"mpch-bitsafe-cbtc\" ↔ Telegram \"mpch\"\n- T-Rize: Slack \"t-rize-bitsafe\" ↔ Telegram \"t-rize\"\n- Komonode: Slack \"komonode-bitsafe\" ↔ Telegram \"komonode\"\n- Chainsafe: Slack \"chainsafe-bitsafe\" ↔ Telegram \"chainsafe\"\n- Copper: Slack \"copper-bitsafe\" ↔ Telegram \"copper\"\n- Launchnodes: Slack \"launchnodes-bitsafe\" ↔ Telegram \"launchnodes\"\n- And 43 more overlaps...\n\nROOT CAUSE:\nThe company_mapping_table.py script has a malformed table output that doesn't properly display overlaps. The actual data shows 49 companies exist in both Slack and Telegram, but the table formatting is broken.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Fix the table formatting in company_mapping_table.py\n2.
