Yes, we have a testnet environment ready that can lock and unlock DLCs with the release version of Leather :+1:   I’ll send some links and instructions shortly, and will include them in the Github issue you mentioned.\n\nHowever, can I ask how you and your team feel about using a custom dev build of Leather for testing? The reason I ask is because we have a version that uses Regtest bitcoin, but it’s only a PR with Kyran now (or about to be). And that version is much faster to test with, as a full DLC flow takes only a few minutes, rather than an hour",
