We’ve been testing out whether we could provide the same user experience without the to-spec DLC library, but rather using PSBTs under the hood. We want to see if we can hit the same security aspects, with self-custodial locking bitcoin and having pre-defined outcomes.\n\nThe benefit, if this could work and our customers felt it was equally good, would mean we would need much less or no customization on the bitcoin wallets.\n\nJust wanted to provide that heads up! Not sure where we’ll land on this yet but we’ll keep your team up to date! Let me know if you have any questions",
