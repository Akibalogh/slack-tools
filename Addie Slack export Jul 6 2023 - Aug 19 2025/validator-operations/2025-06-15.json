We were able to view the wallet GUI (localhost on port 80), but I'm having trouble allowing other users to view it through a secure channel. We're trying to access this dev server via an nginx instance that does SSL termination, but the GUI refuses to load. It asks for a login (administrator), but then there's a loading screen and an error. Any advice on how to configure your dev component so that external users can access it securely?\nAnother issue - how can we attach this docker to our dev wallet?  is it related to the \"party_hint\" argument?  I have ran the script with  -p \"ef-wallet-1\" -m \"2\" -w  args, yet your people have said they are not seeing us on your side. Please advise.",
