About this:\n&gt; In addition, Canton Coin transfers charge fees denominated in Canton Coin itself.\n&gt; Other tokens each define their own fee structure.\nSo, in addition to having available traffic balance, there could also be some fee on the transaction itself and it would depend on each token implementation? If so, where could we get the amulet price of those tokens from in order to calculate the fees?",
