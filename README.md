## Usage

### 1. Ingest Slack Data

```

This will:
- Analyze message content for deal stage signals
- Calculate commission percentages per participant
- Generate detailed justifications
- Output CSV files with results

## Output Files

- **`deal_splits.csv`**: Commission splits per deal/channel
- **`person_rollup.csv`**: Total commission percentages per person
- **`deal_outline.txt`**: Typical deal stage progression
- **`justifications/`**: Detailed markdown files per deal

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Slack token not found"**: Check `config.json` has valid token
2. **"No channels found"**: Verify app has correct OAuth scopes
3. **"Permission denied"**: Ensure app is installed in workspace
4. **Rate limiting**: Tool includes delays, but may need adjustment for large workspaces
