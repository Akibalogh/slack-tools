# RepSplit - Sales Commission Calculator

RepSplit analyzes private Slack channels ending with `-bitsafe` to calculate commission splits based on deal stage participation for your sales team.

## Features

- **Automatic Stage Detection**: Uses keyword patterns to identify deal stages
- **Commission Calculation**: Applies configurable weights and rules for fair distribution
- **Audit Trail**: Every commission allocation is backed by specific message references
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable stage weights, keywords, and participant settings
- **25% Commission Rounding**: Clean, predictable commission percentages
- **Automatic Normalization**: Ensures commissions always sum to 100%

## Business Model

Each `company-bitsafe` Slack channel represents an **entire deal** including both:
- **Holder Product**: Main BitSafe functionality
- **Minter Product**: Minter functionality

Since both products are typically sold together as a package, commission tracking treats each channel as one complete deal for simplicity and accuracy.

## Sales Team

**Commission-Earning Members:**
- Aki (Founder cap applies)
- Addie
- Amy  
- Mayank

**Non-Commission Members:**
- Prateek
- Will
- Kadeem
