## [2024-12-19] - Major Commission Calculation Improvements

### üéØ **Critical Fix: External User Filtering**
- **Problem**: External users (prospects/clients) were being included in commission calculations
- **Root Cause**: Stage detection was counting ALL message authors, not just internal team members
- **Solution**: Updated logic to only include internal team members defined in `config.json`
- **Impact**: 
  - Dramatically improved contestation analysis (66 CLEAR OWNERSHIP vs 55 before)
  - Eliminated confusing "External-XXXX" entries in stage breakdowns
  - More accurate commission attribution (e.g., chata-ai-bitsafe now correctly shows Addie 100% vs 0% before)

### üìä **Enhanced Deal Rationale Output**
- **New File**: `deal_rationale.csv` with comprehensive deal analysis
- **Features**: 
  - Commission percentages for each team member (25% rounded)
  - Contestation level analysis (CLEAR OWNERSHIP, HIGH CONTESTATION, MODERATE CONTESTATION)
  - Most likely owner recommendation
  - **Stage-by-stage breakdown** showing who handled each sales stage:
    - Sourcing/Intro, Discovery/Qual, Solution, Objection, Technical, Pricing, Contract, Scheduling, Closing
  - Detailed rationale explaining commission splits with stage participation details

### üéØ **Improved Contestation Logic**
- **Before**: 41 deals classified as "MODERATE CONTESTATION"
- **After**: Only 3 deals as "MODERATE CONTESTATION", 66 as "CLEAR OWNERSHIP"
- **Logic**: More aggressive identification of clear ownership (60%+ or 40%+ with ‚â§2 participants)

### üîß **User ID Mapping Bug Fix**
- **Issue**: Participants like Addie were showing 0% commission despite active participation
- **Root Cause**: User ID mapping was failing due to empty display names in config
- **Fix**: Updated mapping to use Slack IDs as primary identifier, with fallback to display names

### üßπ **Code Cleanup & Consolidation**
- **Removed**: `commission_analysis.py` (duplicate logic)
- **Consolidated**: All commission calculation logic into single `repsplit.py` file
- **Cleaned**: Removed debug logging for cleaner output
- **Updated**: Configuration and participant management

### üìö **Documentation Updates**
- **README.md**: Added new output file descriptions and enhanced analysis features
- **COMMISSION_CALCULATION.md**: Comprehensive documentation of all recent improvements
- **CHANGELOG.md**: This file documenting all changes

### üìà **Performance Improvements**
