Hey Team, <br><br>I hope this message finds you well! I’m Christoper Vojick reaching out from Roundhill Investment Solutions. We’re an investment firm actively involved in various sectors, including crypto, real estate, solar energy, gas, and sports. <br><br>I wanted to share that we have a high-net-worth client who’s eager to invest in your tokens. They’re interested in making a significant purchase through an OTC transaction, and there&apos;s even potential for a larger investment depending on what’s available. This isn’t a quick flip for them; they’re committed to holding for 3-5 years. <br><br>The best way forward would be to negotiate an OTC deal directly with your leadership team. We would appreciate any guidance you can provide on how to initiate this. Additionally, details about availability, pricing, and settlement terms would be incredibly helpful. <br><br>If you’re interested, we’d love to set up a Zoom call to discuss everything in detail and move this process along quickly. Time is of the essence! <br><br>Looking forward to your response.
