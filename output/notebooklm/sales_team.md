## Commission Calculation Methodology

### Base Commission Calculation
```
Base Commission = Deal Value × Commission Rate × Role Multiplier
```

### Activity Weight Calculation
```
Activity Weight = (Activity Count × Activity Type Weight) / Total Activities
```

### Final Commission Calculation
```
Final Commission = Base Commission × Activity Weight × Time Weight × Contribution Weight
```

### Example Calculation
- Deal Value: $100,000
- Commission Rate: 5%
- Role Multiplier: 0.7 (AE)
- Activity Weight: 0.8 (High activity)
- Time Weight: 1.0 (Consistent involvement)
- Contribution Weight: 1.1 (Critical contribution)

Final Commission = $100,000 × 0.05 × 0.7 × 0.8 × 1.0 × 1.1 = $3,080
