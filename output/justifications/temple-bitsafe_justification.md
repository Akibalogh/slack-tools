  > Hey <@U096KDUK23B>! Q:

Your CBTC Holder license lets you transfer CBTC, and earns you rewards, which is great. Would you want to mint/burn CBTC as well?

If so, we can get you a CBTC Early Bird Holde...

  > Hey <@U096KDUK23B>!  Certainly, you'll need CBTC for Temple.

For Mintify -- will that exist on Canton also?

Or, should we cancel the creds for Mintify?

  > Hi <@U097D8971JQ> - we do have a product called BitSafe vaults. We've paused on it for the time being -- there are low-level things that need to be built out on Canton first. But happy to talk to them
