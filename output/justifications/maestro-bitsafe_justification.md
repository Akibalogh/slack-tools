  > Hi <@U07QFU8Q667> !  With your permission, can we work with <@U08987JD1J9> to migrate you to the new version?

Nothing required on your side, but you'll earn 2X+ rewards ($5-6k/mo)

- **2025-07-20 15:38:55** - Aki (confidence: 0.44)
  > Ready! So, <@U07QFU8Q667>, first I'm going to cancel your credential in the Canton Utility and return the reserve to your wallet

- **2025-07-20 15:40:05** - Aki (confidence: 0.44)
  > Done. 118,104.83 CC is returning to your wallet now

- **2025-07-20 15:40:20** - Aki (confidence: 0.44)
  > Next, <@U07QFU8Q667> send 118,104.83 CC to this address:
`gomaestro::1220409a9fcc5ff6422e29ab978c22c004dde33202546b4bcbde24b25b85353366c2`

- **2025-07-20 15:40:30** - Aki (confidence: 0.44)
  > As soon as it arrives, your rewards will start ticking 2X+

- **2025-07-20 15:40:48** - Aki (confidence: 0.44)
  > The reason is, we built our own credential manager, and ours is much more gas-efficient. And, we return the savings to you

- **2025-07-20 15:41:55** - Aki (confidence: 0.44)
  > In fact, if you want to get a Minter for $10k (200k CCs) also -- that also pays $5-6k/mo, separately
