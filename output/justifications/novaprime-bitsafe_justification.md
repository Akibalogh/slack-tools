  > Ah gotcha. I don't know if that would work, since we've heard that each additional credential from the same issuer drops the rewards for subsequent credential users

- **2025-07-08 13:25:45** - Aki (confidence: 0.44)
  > Have you issued a credential yourself, or just purchased them so far?

  > Ah gotcha. Have you seen that declining behavior on credentials you've issued?

  > Also, there'll be additional rewards from utility of CBTC - rewards for holding and transfering

- **2025-07-08 13:32:49** - Aki (confidence: 0.59)
  > Separately, we'll have a CBTC Minter license, that lets you do BTC LP, trading, etc. - also earning rewards

- **2025-07-08 13:33:17** - Aki (confidence: 0.44)
  > GSF's tokenomics team is shifting rewards toward utility vs. just being on-chain, so we anticipate getting a boost from that

  > There'll be other use cases for BTC on Canton ofc, but that one is being driven by DA itself

- **2025-07-08 13:42:18** - Aki (confidence: 0.47)
  > Sure! Let me know any further questions
