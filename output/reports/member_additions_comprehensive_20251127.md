- All major customer channels (copper-bitsafe, kaleido-bitsafe, blockdaemon-bitsafe, etc.)

*Full list available in audit report: `output/audit_reports/customer_group_audit_20251127_094748.xlsx`*

## Verification

To verify these additions, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/customer_group_audit.py
```

This will generate a fresh audit report showing current membership status for all channels.

---

##Notes

**Special Attention:**
- **bitwave-bitsafe**: Dave Shin was successfully added. Still missing Mayank, Kevin, and Aliya.
- **ext-*** channels**: External/partner channels may have different membership requirements. Verify with channel owners before adding all team members.
- **Non-BitSafe channels**: Channels without "-bitsafe" suffix may not be customer channels and may have different membership policies.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the 29 incomplete channels to determine if all 8 members are actually required
2. For permission-denied channels, contact channel owners
3. For external channels, verify membership requirements with partners
4. Re-run audit to verify all additions were successful
